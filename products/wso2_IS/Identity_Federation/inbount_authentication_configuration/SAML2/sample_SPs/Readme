This jmeter script will be used to test Single Sign On and Single Sign Out.

To run this Jmeter script there are few configurations to be done. Given below are the steps to be followed. 

Step 1 - Deploy the web application

1. Go to tomcat/webapps and deploy the given avis.com.war and travelocity.com.war
2. Start the tomcat

Step 2 - Configure SAML2 SSO using a sample service provider.

1. Start the WSO2 IS carbon server and login to https://localhost:9443/carbon
2. Since you are going to use SAML2 technology, once you login to carbon server which is after IS 4.7.0,

Go to Home > Manage > Service Providers	 > Add > Enter Service Provider ID (travelocity) > SAML2 Web SSO Configuration

3. A form appears. Register the new service provider by providing the following values.

   > Issuer: travelocity.com
    	
   > This value should be same as the SAML.IssuerID value specified inside the travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes/travelocity.properties file.

     Assertion Consumer URL: http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp

   > This value should be same as the SAML.ConsumerUrl value mentioned inside the travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes/travelocity.properties file.
   > NameID format: Enter the default value here (i.e., urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress)
   > Use fully qualified username in the NameID: Set this as true by selecting the checkbox
   > Enable Response Signing: Set this as true by selecting the checkbox
   > Enable Assertion Signing: Set this as true by selecting the checkbox
   > Enable Single Logout: Set this as true by selecting the checkbox

4. Same as step 2 and 3, add the other service provider (avis.com)

E.g., 

  > Issuer: avis.com
    	
  > This value should be same as the SAML.IssuerID value specified inside the travelocity.com/WEB-INF/classes/avis.properties file.

     Assertion Consumer URL: http://localhost:8080/avis.com/samlsso-home.jsp

Step 3 - Jmeter script

1. Up the jmeeter and run the script.

By this Jmeter script following steps will be performed :

1. Go to travelocity login page
2. Login as Admin user
3. Click on avis.com link in the travelocity home page
